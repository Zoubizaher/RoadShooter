## Work journal: 
### Update 1 : 
Create the Basic mechanic of the car movement and jump method using the wheel collider, which is built in unity.
create the car physics component - the rigid body component that gives the object a physical movement around the environment that is affected by gravity.
create the camera to follow a script to follow that follows the car in the x, and y-axis offset from the car and stays on the same z-axis.
create a basic terrain and make a layer called "Ground" to make the car know to recognize where is the ground surface to avoid the car to unlimited jump in the air by using Raycast

### Update 2 : 
limit the car rotation to 45 and -45 in y-axis rotation Euler angles to make the car keep moving forward across the road.
auto-rotate the car toward the direction of the road if not pressing anything or rich the boundaries on the sides.
add points lights to the car, points lights, and directional lights to the environment for better visual.
using particle system components to emit particles from the exhaust in relation to the speed of the car.
using the Trail Renderer component to see where the car is crossing.
add boundaries by clamping the z rotation of the car to avoid the player get out from the road.

### Update 2 : 
To be continued ...
