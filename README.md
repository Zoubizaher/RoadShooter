## Game Mechanics

-   **Top-Down Perspective**: The game features a top-down camera perspective, providing a clear view of the car's surroundings. The car automatically moves forward at a constant speed throughout the game.

-   **Lane Shifting**: The player can move the car left or right to switch between different road paths, avoiding obstacles and aiming for power-ups.
-   **Shooting Mechanism**: The car is equipped with a powerful gun mounted on the roof. Players can fire bullets to destroy walls and shoot down obstacles that descend from the sky.
-   **Power-Ups**: Power-ups, such as shields, can be collected along the road. These shields provide temporary invincibility to walls and other obstacles, offering players a valuable advantage.

## Game Features

-   **Multiple Levels**: The game offers a variety of levels, each with a unique destination to reach. As players progress, the levels become increasingly challenging, featuring harder walls, traps, and the possibility of cliffs where the player's car can fall from.
-   **Endless Gameplay**: Players strive to survive for as long as possible without crashing into walls or falling down cliffs. The game ends when the player's car collides with a wall, falls down a cliff, or successfully reaches the end of the level.
-   **Engaging Visual Design**: The game's visuals are created using the Unity game engine. The player's car is designed to resemble a classic vehicle, utilizing basic primitives within Unity. A cubic gun is mounted on the car's roof, adding a unique and distinctive look. Walls and obstacles are represented by cubes and spheres, while the road is constructed using the Unity Terrain System.
